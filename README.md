## About
I look at cybersecurity from both sides of the coin. Without attackers, there would be no need for security parameters. Both sides pour serious time, skill and resources
into their projects, especially when valuble systems or data are at stake. It's always compelling watching an attacker attempt to bypass well-configured defence lines,
and then trace all the steps they took to do it.

On the other hand, defending systems is also thrilling and is what pushed me towards learning more about cybersecurity. The feeling you get detecting a suspicious login
or stop a brute-force login attempt before it causes harm? That feeling is unmatched and sits with you for the rest of your carreer after countless hours setting up 
monitoring, analyzing logs, and tuning alerts. On the flip side, working offensively gives you constant puzzles: new vunerabilities to dissect, attack patterns to 
simulate, and exploits to understand. The ongoing cat-and-mouse between attackers and defenders intimidates people, but that's exactly what keeps me engaged. There's
always something to uncover, something to defend, and the challange never ends.

## Learning Path

This portfolio reflects my progressionm in building hands-on cybersecurity skills. My current focus areas include but are not limited to:

- Week 1–2: Windows OS fundamentals, virtual machine setup, and baseline system behavior
- Week 3–4: Security logging, failed login detection, and initial incident analysis
- Week 5–6: Sysmon deployment, basic SIEM exposure, and alert creation
- Week 7+: Full SOC lab projects, end-to-end attack detection, and incident reporting
