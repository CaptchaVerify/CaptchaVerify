## About
I look at cybersecurity from both sides of the coin. Without attackers, there would be no need for security parameters. Both sides pour serious time, skill and resources into their projects, especially when valuble systems or data are at stake. It's always compelling watching an attacker attempt to bypass well-configured defence lines, and then trace all the steps they took to do it.
